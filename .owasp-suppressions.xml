    OWASP Dependency Check - CVE Suppression File
    ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

    PURPOSE:
    This file allows temporary suppression of specific CVE findings from OWASP
    Dependency Check. Use ONLY when absolutely necessary and with proper
    documentation.

    WHEN TO USE SUPPRESSIONS:
    1. No fix/patch is available from the vendor
    2. Vulnerability doesn't apply to our specific usage pattern
    3. False positive (verified by security team)
    4. Risk has been formally accepted and documented in risk register

    APPROVAL PROCESS:
    - All suppressions MUST be reviewed and approved by Security Team
    - Document the business justification and compensating controls
    - Set review dates to re-evaluate suppressions quarterly
    - Never suppress CRITICAL vulnerabilities without executive approval

    DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS:
    Each suppression MUST include:
    - <notes> explaining WHY it's safe to suppress
    - Risk acceptance date and reviewer name
    - Planned remediation date (if applicable)
    - Reference to risk register entry or ticket number

          No patch available yet (vendor ETA: Q2 2026)

          - Database user has read-only permissions (least privilege)
          - WAF rules blocking SQL injection patterns

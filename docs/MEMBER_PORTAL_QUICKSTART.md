# Member Portal - Quick Start

## What We're Building
Member-facing portal separate from admin portal.

## Setup Steps

### 1. Run Setup Script
```bash
cd ~/Desktop/Projects/Data\ in\ Logistics/repo/ASR/member-portal
bash setup.sh
```

This will:
- Create React app with TypeScript
- Install Kendo React components
- Install dependencies

### 2. Start Development
```bash
npm start
```

Portal runs on `http://localhost:3001` (different from admin on 3000)

## Features To Build

### Phase 1 (Basic - No Auth)
- ✅ Landing page
- ✅ Profile viewer
- ✅ Token download

### Phase 2 (With Auth)
- Login/logout
- Edit profile
- Support tickets

## Next Steps
After setup completes, I'll create:
1. Landing page
2. Profile component
3. Token management
4. Basic navigation

**Estimated:** 2-3 days for basic version

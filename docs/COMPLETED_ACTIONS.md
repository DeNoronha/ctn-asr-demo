This file tracks all completed work in chronological order (most recent first).

| Date | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 2025-10-25 | **Admin Portal Refactoring and Deployment Completed** - Successfully refactored web/ folder to admin-portal/ with complete deployment pipeline fixes. Updated .azure-pipelines/admin-portal.yml with correct paths (admin-portal/ instead of web/). Fixed root package.json workspace configuration to reference admin-portal/ instead of web/. Regenerated package-lock.json after workspace changes to fix npm ci errors in CI/CD (critical for monorepo builds). Fixed Dashboard/Members 404 issue - root cause was API not deployed, deployed API to Azure Function App with `func azure functionapp publish func-ctn-demo-asr-dev --typescript --build remote`. Verified all endpoints working (members, legal entities, identifiers). Removed Portbase logo from login page (kept 3 partner logos: Contargo, Inland Terminals Group, Van Berkel). Comprehensive agent analysis completed: SA identified 19 vulnerabilities, CR found 18 code quality issues, DA discovered 14 UX/accessibility improvements. Analysis reports stored in admin-portal/ (SECURITY_ANALYSIS.md, CODE_REVIEW.md, DESIGN_ANALYSIS.md, IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md). Repository structure verified: root contains only README.md and CLAUDE.md, all other .md files properly organized in docs/ or project-specific folders. Estimated effort: 6 hours |
| 2025-10-21 | **KvK API Integration for Automated Verification** - Completed production configuration of existing KvK API integration in both development and production environments. Discovered existing implementation in api/src/services/kvkService.ts and api/src/functions/uploadKvkDocument.ts. Added KvK API key (apikey header authentication) to .credentials file for documentation, api/local.settings.json for local development, and Azure Function App settings (func-ctn-demo-asr-dev) for production deployment. Integration validates Dutch company data against Kamer van Koophandel (Chamber of Commerce) registry at https://api.kvk.nl/api/v1, checks for bankruptcies, dissolutions, and name mismatches, updates legal_entity table with verification status (verified/flagged/failed). Enables automated company verification for Dutch members during onboarding and periodic verification workflows. No code changes required - infrastructure configuration only. Estimated effort: 1 hour |
| 2025-10-21 | **CTN Documentation Portal - MCP SSE Proxy for Claude Desktop** - Created proxy script to bridge Claude Desktop (stdio) to remote SSE MCP server. Built proxy with stdio/SSE protocol conversion, SSE client implementation with retry logic and connection monitoring, heartbeat mechanism with 30s timeout detection, graceful error handling and shutdown. Created installation script (install-mcp-proxy.sh) with download-and-configure one-liner. Created comprehensive documentation (docs/how-to/configure-mcp-server-claude-desktop.md) with installation steps, architecture explanation, troubleshooting guide, and team distribution strategy. Proxy downloadable from docs portal at /scripts/mcp-sse-proxy.js for easy team sharing. Enables Claude Desktop users to connect to CTN Documentation Portal SSE-based MCP server with simple command-line installation. Files: ctn-docs-portal/scripts/mcp-sse-proxy.js (proxy), ctn-docs-portal/docs/how-to/configure-mcp-server-claude-desktop.md (docs). Commits: e7d8d1a, b06b5ec. Estimated effort: 3 hours |

Updated build script (scripts/md-to-html.js) to copy favicon to public root directory during build process. Updated all HTML templates (layout.html, home.html, architecture.html) to reference /favicon.ico in <link rel="icon"> tags. Ensures consistent CTN branding across all portals (admin, member, docs). Files: ctn-docs-portal/src/images/favicon.ico (new), ctn-docs-portal/scripts/md-to-html.js (updated), ctn-docs-portal/src/templates/layout.html, home.html, architecture.html (updated). Commit: 8079dbc. Estimated effort: 30 minutes |
| 2025-10-21 | **CTN Documentation Portal - HowTo Section Made Collapsible** - Modified sidebar script (scripts/generate-sidebar.js) to make HowTo section collapsible like arc42 section. Changed collapsible condition from files.length > 3 to files.length > 1, added collapse button with bi-chevron-down icon, added proper CSS classes (has-children, collapsible), updated sidebar template (src/templates/sidebar.html) to support collapse/expand functionality. HowTo section now starts collapsed by default and can be expanded by users. Improves navigation UX by reducing vertical scrolling on mobile devices. Files: ctn-docs-portal/scripts/generate-sidebar.js, ctn-docs-portal/src/templates/sidebar.html. Commit: f51b0c6. Estimated effort: 30 minutes |
| 2025-10-21 | **CTN Documentation Portal - IcePanel Diagram Embed Fixed** - Fixed "content blocked" error on architecture page by changing IcePanel embed URL from /DyzP to /E1Su. Added proper iframe styling (border-radius: 8px, border:none) for professional appearance. Updated page title from "Architecture Diagrams" to "CTN Association Register - Architecture" to match official project name. Diagram now loads correctly at https://delightful-desert-0e783ed03.1.azurestaticapps.net/docs/architecture.html. File: ctn-docs-portal/src/templates/architecture.html. Commit: f51b0c6. Estimated effort: 15 minutes |
| 2025-10-21 | **ASR API - Database Transactions Already Implemented** - Discovered existing withTransaction helper function in api/src/utils/database.ts providing complete transaction support with automatic rollback on error. Helper uses PostgreSQL client.query('BEGIN'), client.query('COMMIT'), and client.query('ROLLBACK') for ACID compliance. Already integrated in 3 critical operations: CreateMember (api/src/functions/CreateMember.ts lines 171-186) for atomic member creation with legal entity and contact, UpdateLegalEntity (api/src/functions/UpdateLegalEntity.ts lines 93-108) for atomic legal entity updates with audit logging, UpdateMemberProfile (api/src/functions/UpdateMemberProfile.ts lines 86-101) for atomic profile updates with audit logging. Transaction helper provides error handling, automatic cleanup, and proper isolation levels. No additional work required - database transaction infrastructure already exists and is actively used. Impact: Confirms ACID compliance for critical multi-step operations, prevents partial writes/data corruption. Discovery: October 21, 2025 during ROADMAP cleanup |
| 2025-10-19 | **AUTH-001: Azure AD User → Party ID Resolution** - Implemented database-backed party ID resolution for orchestration API authorization. Added resolvePartyId() function in api/src/middleware/auth.ts (lines 231-267) that queries members → legal_entity → party_reference tables to map Azure AD object_id (oid) to party_id. Query filters out deleted/inactive records and returns party_id for multi-tenant authorization checks. Integrated into authentication middleware (line 390-413) and used by all orchestration endpoints (GetOrchestrations, GetOrchestrationDetails, GetEvents). SQL query joins 3 tables with proper status filtering (m.status != 'DELETED', le.is_deleted = false, pr.is_deleted = false). Impact: Orchestration API is now production-ready with proper party-level authorization, unblocks Orchestrator Portal for production deployment. Estimated effort: 3 hours |
| 2025-10-19 | **Health Check Dashboard Implementation** - Created comprehensive system health monitoring dashboard for operations team.

Implementation: web/src/components/audit/AuditLogViewer.tsx (284 lines), web/src/services/auditLogService.ts. Accessible from Admin Sidebar "Audit Logs" menu (route: 'audit'). **L5: Contextual help system (3h)** - Comprehensive help tooltips throughout application. Implementation: web/src/components/help/HelpTooltip.tsx (info icon with Kendo tooltip), web/src/components/help/FieldHelp.tsx (label + tooltip wrapper), web/src/config/helpContent.ts (158 lines covering all features). Actively used in MemberForm, ContactForm, IdentifiersManager, EndpointManagement. Topics: member registration, contacts, identifiers (LEI/KVK/EORI), endpoints, BVAD, users, orchestration, tokens, documents, newsletters. **L6: Progressive disclosure for complex forms (2h)** - Collapsible sections with localStorage persistence and multi-step wizard. Implementation: web/src/components/forms/ProgressiveSection.tsx (collapsible sections with state persistence), web/src/components/forms/StepperForm.tsx (multi-step wizard with Kendo Stepper, step validation, direct navigation). Actively used in MemberRegistrationWizard (multi-step registration), MemberForm (collapsible advanced sections), ContactForm (progressive disclosure). **Impact:** All 8 Low Priority UI/UX tasks now 100% complete (was 62.5%). Total effort: 11 hours. Release readiness increased from 95% to 96%. Commits from 2025-10-19 (found via git history search) |

Commit: e52e5ad |
| 2025-10-19 | **CRITICAL Security Fixes - Orchestration API IDOR and Injection Vulnerabilities** - Fixed 4 critical security vulnerabilities in orchestration API identified by SA agent review. **IDOR-001**: Added party involvement verification in GetOrchestrationDetails (api/src/functions/GetOrchestrationDetails.ts lines 76-107) - prevents unauthorized access to orchestration details across party boundaries, returns 404 instead of 403 to prevent information disclosure, logs IDOR attempts with security_issue: 'IDOR_ATTEMPT'. **IDOR-002**: Added party involvement verification in GetEvents (api/src/functions/GetEvents.ts lines 61-91) - prevents unauthorized access to event data across party boundaries, identical protection pattern. **INJ-001**: Deprecated executeQuery() function in gremlinClient.ts to prevent Gremlin injection attacks - function now throws error "executeQuery() is deprecated for security reasons", all endpoints migrated to safe parameterized helper functions (getOrchestrationsForParty, getOrchestrationDetails, isPartyInvolvedInOrchestration, getEventsForOrchestration). **SEC-001**: Added Cosmos DB credential validation at startup (api/src/utils/gremlinClient.ts lines 12-26) - validates COSMOS_ORCHESTRATION_ENDPOINT, COSMOS_ORCHESTRATION_KEY, and database name are present, validates HTTPS endpoint format, provides clear error messages for missing configuration. Security pattern: New helper function isPartyInvolvedInOrchestration() verifies party membership before returning data, comprehensive audit logging captures all IDOR attempts, returns 404 (not 403) for unauthorized access. Testing: TE agent created orchestration-security-test.sh (13 tests, 4 passed, 9 skipped awaiting auth tokens), code review verified all 4 fixes implemented correctly, manual runtime testing required with actual party tokens and Cosmos DB data. Deployment: Committed (41bc2c6), deployed to Azure Functions, all endpoints responding correctly. Status: Code fixes VERIFIED, production readiness REQUIRES runtime validation with test data.

| 2025-10-18 | **Orchestration API Implementation and Security Review Completed** - Built complete orchestration API with Azure Cosmos DB (Gremlin graph database) and 4 Azure Functions (GetOrchestrations, GetOrchestrationDetails, GetEvents, GetWebhooks). Created OrchestrationDB database and Orchestrations graph. Stored Cosmos DB credentials in Azure Key Vault. Implemented gremlin npm package integration with graph traversal utilities (api/src/utils/gremlinClient.ts). Added orchestration RBAC permissions (READ_ORCHESTRATIONS, MANAGE_ORCHESTRATIONS). Registered all functions in essential-index.ts and deployed to Azure Functions (all endpoints responding with HTTP 401 auth required). SA agent security review identified 5 CRITICAL/HIGH vulnerabilities: IDOR-001 (party verification missing in GetOrchestrationDetails), IDOR-002 (party verification missing in GetEvents), INJ-001 (Gremlin injection in executeQuery), SEC-001 (missing credential validation), AUTH-001 (Azure AD → party ID resolution not implemented). Production status: 🛑 BLOCKED until IDOR vulnerabilities fixed. Release readiness decreased from 85% to 70% |
| 2025-10-18 | **CRITICAL Security Fixes and Comprehensive Testing Completed** - Completed all automated security improvements and comprehensive testing (49 tests, 96% pass rate).
